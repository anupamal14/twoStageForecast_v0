Description: Models time series data with multiple levels of seasonality.
      It achieves this in two stages. In the first stage, data is 
      aggregated to a lower frequency and models are fitted. In the second 
      stage, the seasonality is estimated for the high frequency data.
      Finally, the two stages are combined.
